# Er subset for R

Not to be confused with **Er**lang, especially since this is not a language, but a subset/extension of an existing language (R)

`Р (er) unofficially: Я is a set of subsets for the R programming language that enable native Cyrillic-based language support, making it easier to program in R in 20+ different languages.`

## Source trunk

The [`Er`](/Er/) source trunk currently contains partial support for the following language: <!-- (s) !-->

- [ ] Ukrainian ([`uk-ukr`](/Er/uk-ukr/))

Support for 20+ other languages is coming soon.

## Documentation

Documentation is located [:octocat: `Here`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Er_Docs/)
